About:

This projet used Pandas / Jupyter Notebook to clean data collected from the USDA and the USGS on honey bee colonies, honey production, and pesticide use in the United States.

The transformed datasets were loaded into a SQL database. Flask was then used to query the SQL database and return a JSON list for each state's data.
